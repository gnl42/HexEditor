JarBundler
==========

JarBundler is a feature-rich Ant task which will create a Mac OS X application bundle from a list of Jar files and a main class name.
You can add an Icon resource, set various Mac OS X native look-and-feel bells and whistles, and maintain your application bundles as part of your normal build and release cycle.

See "https://github.com/UltraMixer/JarBundler" and the downloaded "jarbundler.html".
